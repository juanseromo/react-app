<h1>Fetching data from XKCD's API. Rendered with React. 
CORS errors avoided through Express. </h1>

In order to execute this app you must first cd on to react-app folder to run 'node server.js', this will turn the Express server on port 8000, which is evading the CORS error provoked by the XKCD's API. Once the CORS error is deactivated from Express, we can run 'npm start'.

Once both servers are turned on we can visit http://127.0.0.1:3000 and look at the app.
